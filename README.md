Repo for CS 81 class

1. Function that uses Math.sum for simple addition.

2. A function that bullies users whos name aren't Daisy. Used .toUpperCase so that name capitalizations didn't matter.

3. Counts to 100. Loops while i <101 for the hundred-count

4. Returns absolute value, but doesn't safeguard against invalid entries

5. Arrow function for one of the great philosophical questions. The syntax feels simple, and yet so confusing because it's different from the function declarations/expressions.
